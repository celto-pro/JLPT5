JLPT5_kanji_json_creation's input are the path to two json's file:
- first one has key that are kanji and values that are translation
- second one has key that are french+on/kun-yumi and values are kanji

This function initializes all scores and level respectivly to 0 and 1.

## json's file modification.
'''
To modify a value => "global_functions.jap_JLPT_update_value(path, key, value)"
This function accesses the key and change the value to the one given as input

To modify a key => "global_functions.jap_JLPT_update_key(path, key, new_key)"
This function keeps a value and modify a key to the new_key input parameter.

Possible paths:
- 'jap_alphabet.json'
- 'JLPT5_jap_kanji.json' & 'JLPT5_fr_kanji.json'
- ??

### Example: "global_functions.jap_JLPT_update_value('JLPT5_jap_kanji.json', key, value)"  ###










## S'entraÃ®ner avec les 80 kanjis du JLPT5

'''
There are two different training functions for the JLPT5 80's kanjis
kanjis_training_JLPT5 which is similar to exam's one => Ask training_size*10 questions in both translation sens
